# Mining-useful-alleles-for-climate-change-adaptation
In this research of finding useful alleles in plant crop species for climate change adaptation, I use simulations to explore several breeding approaches to find which approach is more efficient and takes less time and efforts to get useful results.
In this repository you can find a summary of GEA methods with links to tutorials and references.
a pdf file with the presentation of the reaserach plan I presented at the allele mining virtual meeting October 12 2022 and R scripts for the project.
